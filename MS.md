"Micro-frontends: Building Large-Scale Web Applications with a Modular Component-Based Architecture"
Decomposing Front-end Applications into Micro-Frontend The Benefits and Challenges

Micro frontends are a hot topic in web development circles these days. By breaking up a monolithic frontend into smaller, more manageable pieces, developers can improve the overall maintainability and scalability of their web applications. And, by using a tool like next.js, they can take advantage of the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) and code splitting to further improve performance. In this thesis, we will explore the feasibility of using a micro frontend approach with next.js to build a large-scale web application. We will start by looking at the benefits of micro frontends and how they can be used to improve the maintainability and scalability of web applications. We will then look at how next.js can be used to take advantage of the benefits of SSR and code splitting. Finally, we will put everything together and build a large-scale web application using a micro frontend approach with next.js.







- global state management across micro frontends?
- sharing components across micro frontends?
- SSD or CSR?
- message queue or SSD api like nextjs?
